# Glossary

* Model
> A mathematical representation of a System or a System of Systems, which is used to simulate its behaviour.

* Wrapp
> In SoSTrades, a Wrapp refers to a SosWrap that is a model wrapper for SoSTrades application

* Process
> In SoSTrades, a group of SoSDisciplines interacting together.

* Usecase
> In SosTrades, allows to define a set of input variables for a study and to run this study with thus values. 

* Coupling
> In SoSTrades and Gemseo, coupling means associating output variables of a model to the input variables of another model.

* Namespace
> In SoSTrades namespaces allows to add prefixes in front of the variable names in order to avoid unwanted matches of variables and to define a data tree breakdown

* Gemseo
> Generic Engine for Multi-disciplinary Scenarios, Exploration and Optimisation: model simulation Python library.

* MDA
> Multidisciplinary Analysis.

* MDO
> Multidisciplinary Design Optimisation.

* Study
> In SoSTrades, an instantiation of a process.

* SoS
> System of Systems representing Business Functions.
