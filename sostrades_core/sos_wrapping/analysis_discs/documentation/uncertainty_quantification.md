The sensitivity analysis determines how different values of independent variables affect a particular dependent variable under a given set of assumptions.

## Inputs Data

The uncertainty quantification model takes as inputs 2 variables:
- **Samples**: the samples of inputs values by scenario
- **Data**: the several outputs values generated by scenario
Those variables allow to have a first set of assumptions in order to interpolate later the data on input distributions.

After a first configuration, The inputs distribution can be fixed thanks to the:
- **Inputs Distribution Parameters**: to specify distribution parameters as :
  - the distribution type (choice between 'LogNormal', 'Normal', 'PERT' or 'Triangular')
  - the lower/upper parameter
  - the most probable value (if needed - 'PERT' or 'Triangular')
- **Data Details**: for the display, it is possible to specify the name and unit of inputs/outputs used. Notice the variable is by default filled thanks to the ontology if the name of the variable is known.

Notice, there is a possibility in expert mode to configure the **confidence interval** and the **sample size** on the 'Numerical parameters' tab.

## Outputs generation

In the model, each distribution is attributed to the inputs associated over a set of samples. Then a sample is generated from the composed distribution of each inputs. At the end an interpolation, based on the initial data, of the composed distribution sample gives each output interpolated values.

For instance, here is an example of a Normal distribution of the input 'COC' with the mean, lower/upper parameters displayed on the histogram, and the median values in the annotation upper right.

Here is an example of the output 'Cashflow' interpolated values with the mean, lower/upper values displayed on the histogram and the extrem values of the confidence interval. Here, as the confidence interval is 80%, there is a 80% chance that the cashflow values will be between -69.04keuros and 82keuros.
