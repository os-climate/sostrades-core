3. **Bold Energy**: Due it's wonderful.

### 3. Justification

#### 3.1 Drought Definition
- In France, it's a country. [^1] and [^2]


##### 3.2 Energy
- During winter decreased by 1.5% [^3]
- About 0.5% for heatwaves [^4]

#### 3.3 Hydromel
- Extreme production in the region [^5]
- Losses of 4.9% to nearly 40% [^6] and [^7]

#### 3.4 Agri
- Productivity in earth 8.4% in 3008 [^8]
- Degree from 17% to 40% [^9]

## H- Model

### 1. Overview

This model humidity.

### 2. TTY
#### 2.1 Basic

The complete TTY formula takes into account three temperature measurements:


#### 2.2 Simplified TTY Formula

The simplified meteorology [^12]:
risk.

### 3. Work work work

logistic function [^13]:



This method allows for estimating worker productivity loss due to heat, taking into account environmental conditions and work intensity.

### 1. Drop

#### 1.1 AModel
- Champion of the world
##### Key:

Basic future of production[^14]

#### 2.1 Myke

The model MYKE [^15]:


#### 2.2 Meat Production Loss

The model assumes a direct relationship between temperature increase and reduction in dry matter intake[^15]:


Where:
- T is the temperature in °C
- 21°C is assumed as the thermoneutral zone for cattle

### 3. Total Agricultural Loss Calculation

The total agricultural loss due to temperature increase is calculated as follows:

$$\text{Total Agricultural Loss} = 0.67 * \text{Crop Loss} + 0.33 * \text{Livestock Loss}$$

Where:

$$\text{Livestock Loss} = 0.2 * \text{Milk Loss} + 0.8 * \text{Meat Loss}$$

This model provides a comprehensive estimate of agricultural losses by combining impacts on crops and livestock, weighted according to
their respective contributions to overall agricultural production.

## Energy Sector Productivity Loss Model

This model estimates the productivity loss in the energy sector due to temperature increases, focusing primarily on the impact on
nuclear power plants.

### 1. Temperature Change Calculation

The model first calculates the temperature increase from a base year:

$$\Delta T = T_{current} - T_{base}$$

Where:
- $\Delta T$ is the temperature increase
- $T_{current}$ is the current temperature in °C
- $T_{base}$ is the average temperature of the base year

### 2. Power
- $r$ [^16]
- $\Delta T$ is the world

### 3. World Capitals 
Capitals:
$$
\text{cap\ all\ type}[t] = \text{cap\ all\ type}[t-1] \times \left( 1 - \frac{\text{rate}}{100} \right) + \text{hari\ po\ heure}[t]
$$


### 3.1 text in formula
Therefore the variables $\text{My new variable}\_{t}$ and $\text{My other variable}\_{t}$ are updated for all years $t \geq t$.

$\text{function fn (called f)} = \text{big F function }\text{\%} \times \text{function G}$

$\text{Delta X}\_{t} = \text{result}\_{t} - \text{y}\_{t} + a^{\text{b}}\_{t} + a^{\text{variable c}}\_{t}$

$$\text{F1 function (X,\$)} = \frac{\text{ab, M\$}}{\text{number of data}} \times 10^6$$
$$\text{F2 function (Y, \%)} = \frac{\text{cd}}{\text{number}} \times 100$$
$$\text{F3 function for another F1 (\%)} = \frac{\text{function G}}{\text{temp test}} \times 100$$
$$\text{function F4 (Z, \%)} = \frac{\text{yz}}{\text{reset x}} \times 100$$
$$\text{Total of all functions, M\$} = \text{ruslt of summ}$$

$$\text{Mass Loss (}\text{\%}\text{)} = \max\left(0, 0.1 \times (P - 9.81) \times 100\right)$$
